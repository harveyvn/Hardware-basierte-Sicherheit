# Trusted Platform Modules & Intel SGX

## I. Introduction to Trusted System Concepts

### 1. Trusted System

- A system is trusted if it always **behaves** in the **expected manner** for the **intended purpose**

### 2. Trusted Platforms

- Trusted Platforms provide **Trusted Components** in **HW & SW**
- Trusted Platform should be **minimized** and **compatible** to **commodity systems**
- **Trusted Components** provide a set of **cryptographic and security** functions
  - To create **trust foundation** for SW
  - To provide **protection** to HW

### 3. Goals

- Improve **security** of **computing platforms**
- **Reuse** existing **software modules**
- **Applicable** to **different OS**
- **Open** **architecture**
- **Efficient** **portability**
- Allow **realization** of **new applications** and **business models**

### 4. Desired Primitives

#### 4.1. Metric for Code Configuration

- I/O behavior of machine based on an initial state
- Represented by the hash value of the binary code
- Problems arise when functionality depends on codes not included in hashing

#### 4.2. Integrity Verification

- **Computing platform** can export **verifiable information** about its **properties**

#### 4.3. Secure Storage

- To persist data securely between executions using traditional untrusted storage like hard drives
- To encrypt data and assured to be the only capable of decrypting it

#### 4.4. Strong Process Isolation

- Not allow reading and modifying other process memory

#### 4.5. Secure I/O

- Assure the **end-points** of input and output of operations
- A user can **interact securely** with the **intended application**

## II. Trusted Platform Modules

### 1. Chain of Trust

- Given a set of entities $\{ E_0, E_1, ... , E_n \}$
- **Purpose** is to **gain Trust** for Entity $E_n$
  - To trust $E_n$ , we must trust $E_{n-1}$
- $E_0, E_1, ... , E_n$ creates ***Chain of Trust***

#### 1.1. Transitive Trust

- **Trust** is **transitive** from $E_0$ to $E_1$ to $E_2$
- Trusting $E_0$ does NOT mean trusting $E_2$
- Trusting $E_2$ requires to trust $E_0$ and $E_1$

### 2. Performing Integrity Measurements

#### 2.1. What does one need to trust the chain?

- Need **identity** of each item in the chain
- **Identity** should be **equal** to **measurement**
  - Each item **measures** the **next item** before **passing the control** to the next item
  - **Root of Trust for Measurements** will measure $E_0$

### 3. Trusted Platform Module - TPM

- TPM is **cryptographic co-processor**
- **Embedded** into the **platform motherboard**
- Provide a set of **cryptographic and security functions**, **secure storage** and **platform integrity measurement**
- Acts as RTM
- **Components**: SHA-1, Random Number Generation, Key Generation, Platform Configuration Register ...

#### 3.1. Endorsement Key

- Endorsement Key is TPM **identity**, embedded in TPM
- **Verified** by Endorsement Credential

#### 3.2. TPM Ownership

- Prove the knowledge of the owner credential to TPM
- Assertion via physical presence

### 4. Platform Configuration Registers - PCRs

- It is **shielded location** to **store** **integrity measurement values**
- **Integrity measurement** is hashing **the current state of application** and **the prev. $PCR_i$** as follow $PCR_{i+1} \leftarrow SHA1( PCR_I, value )$. This will result a **hash chain**
- Through the **PCR extension**, $PCR_i$ value **depends** on the **previous** $PCR_{i-1}$ **measurement** in order to **create** ***Chain of Trust***

### 5. Core Root of Trust for Measurement - CRTM

- **Immutable portion** of the **host platform**â€™s initialization code that executes **after** host platform **resets**
- **CRTM implementations**: BIOS or BIOS Boot Block

## III. Basic Applications

### 1. Secure Storage

- **Simulate** unlimited secure storage through **encryption**
- Generate new key
- Encrypt the key by **Storage Root Key**
- Encrypt data
- Move data out of TPM
- When we want to access data, bring data back to TPM and decrypt

#### 1.1. Sealing

- Bind data to a **specific TPM**
- Used with non-migratable key
- **Data** can be **decrypted** only if **platform** is in a **pre-defined state**

#### 1.2. Binding

- Conventional **asymmetric** encryption
- **Used to** bind data to a specific TPM that know **corresponding** key
- Used with non-migratable key / migratable key
- **No interaction** with TPM required

#### 1.3. Non-migratable key vs Migratable key

- Non-migratable key is **a unique key** bound to **a specific TPM**. Cannot migrate to other TPM
- Migratable key is a **key not bounding** to a specific TPM. Can use or move to other TPM with **suitable authorization**

### 2. Attestation

- **Report** of **state** of platform to **verifier**, signed by **Attestation Identity Key**

## IV. Intel SGX

### 1. Goals

- **Protect** the **execution** of a certain **code fragment**

### 2. Assumptions

- Security critical code is isolated in an enclave
- Only CPU is trusted
- Enclaves cannot harm the system

### 3. SGX Enclaves

- Extension of x86 architecture
- Enclaves are isolated memory regions of code and data
- Controlled by CPU
- Memory is protected by encryption and integrity protection
